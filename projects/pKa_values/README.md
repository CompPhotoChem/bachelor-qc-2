In the previous [TD-DFT exercise](https://github.com/CompPhotoChem/bachelor-qc-2/tree/main/azobenzene), we studied the absorption spectra of the neutral and protonated forms of methyl yellow (MY), 
observing a color change from yellow (neutral) to red (protonated) with decreasing pH.

Now, we will focus on calculating the pKa value of the protonated form of MY to determine at which pH the solution remains yellow and when it turns red.

## Goals

- compute the pKa-values of protonated dyes
- compare computed and measured pKa
- compare the pKa values of isomers

## Calculations

Compute the **pKa** values of *E*- and *Z*-AB as well as *E*- and *Z*-MY. The **experimental pKa of MY** was determined to be **3.3**.
Can theory reprocude this value? Which isomer is associated with that value: *E*, *Z* or a mixture?
